/**
 *	In order to style WooCommerce try to take as much from their stylesheets as possible,
 *		add it in this folder,
 *		and then dequeue their stylesheets completely in the woo-hooks.php file.
 *
 *		This lets us use some of their styles without having to load a ton of unnecessary CSS
 *		that we would override anyway.
 *
 *		Make sure to include styles from their stylesheets in a file separate from this one,
 *		but in this same folder.
